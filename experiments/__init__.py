"""
MLflow experiment scripts.

Each experiment answers one specific question:
- feature_selection: Which features matter most?
- model_comparison: Which model architecture works best?
- hyperparameter: What are the optimal hyperparameters?
- temporal_stability: Does the model generalize across years?
- regional_transfer: Does the model transfer to other regions?
